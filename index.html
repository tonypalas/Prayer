      “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,

      <h3>My Prayer</h3>
      <p>
        My prayer is that as we draw closer to Christ's return, His bride will draw closer to Him.
        May His church be without spot or wrinkle, in one accord, giving Him all the glory for what He has done.
        Holy Spirit, call us to our knees—our rightful battle position—as we fight to advance Your Kingdom in our lives and all around us.
        Use this time of prayer and fasting to purify my heart and align my spirit with Your will.
        Amen.
